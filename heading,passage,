The natural environment or natural world </br>encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, </br>meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to Earth or some parts of Earth. <pre>This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, </b><i>including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, the atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature.</i>
<mark>universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries,</mark> <u>such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions.</u>

People cannot find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other.<sup> The massive environmental changes of humanity in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural environments: including from climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other chemicals in the air and water.</sup> <sub> More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.</sub>[2]<small> If, for instance, in an agricultural field,</small> <big> the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil,</big> <del>but the structure is quite different.</del>
